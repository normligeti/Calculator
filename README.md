# Calculator
A simple GUI calculator capable of performing the four basic operations on two operands.
It's behaviour is based on the windowd 7 default calculator:
- every second operation first performs the previous operation, and takes the result as the first operand for the current operation
- pressing the result button multiple times repeats the last operation

The calculator supports floating-point, and negative numbers.
